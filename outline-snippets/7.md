# Future Work

## DCN-PD:
- Multiple treatments?
- Time series data? 
- Can we adapt our multi-class learning to an RNN? 
- Propensity-based DropConnect?

## DCN-LA:
- Run data on other datasets
- Improve empirical model (more training data, other heuristics to infer the charactistics, etc.)
- More experiments, 
- Other features?
