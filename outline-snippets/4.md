# Motivation
- DCN can be effective
- What's the proper architecture?
- Hyper-param search is computationally expensive

# Architecture Learning
- There has to be an ideal architecture 
- But that's dependent on certain characteristics
- Use empirical model to find suitable ratios
- EM: Inputs are characteristics, outputs 
    are appropriate ratios

- For new dataset, we infer characteristics (see below)
- Feed them into empirical model, obtain optimal ratios


(## Empirical Model)
- How did we train it? How does it work in detail? 

## Characteristics
- Automatically learning an appropriate architecture
- Copy section from paper

## Algorithm
- Show Pseudocode
